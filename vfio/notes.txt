A couple notes:

- When unbinding parts of the GPU, all pieces must be unbound. However, only the first two should be passed through to the VM (e.g. leave the USB controllers out).

- When working with looking glass, disable the virtual touchscreen passed through to get mouse input to work.

- Have a dummy port connected via HDMI, not via DisplayPort. The DisplayPort dummy plug will half work, but you won't be able to see anything other than the skeleton of windows.

- The mount / unmount scripts should work, but will take their sweetass time with the USB controller pieces of the GPU. Be patient with them.

- Moving the libvirt hook scripts requires using stow to a specific location (e.g. "stow libvirt/ -t /etc/")
